I thought it might be useful to also cover a little on the company day - what it is, what to expect, why we're having it.   I thought you & Nelson might be able to cover this?  We only have 30 mins for the whole meeting, so this would be maybe 5 minutes, to give some highlights, get people excited about it. Are you happy to do this?  Sorry for the late notice, I realise you are not in today, and Nelson won't be in tomorrow, but I am hoping that it won't take much prep.   thanks Shy (edited) "},

I think itâ€™ll be worthwhile using D&L sessions as much as possible rather than Munch & Learn, we can look to extending some session if needed depending on the agenda. Thanks."},
